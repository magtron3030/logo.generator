# Logo Generator

## Description 
I created this so the user could easily create a logo using the command-line so they dont have to pay a graphic desginer. This logo can have the shape, background color, and text color changed and is then saved as a SVG file.

## Usage
Open the terminal in the develope folder to get started. Once there, type in 'node index.js' and a prompt will appear asking the user to enter up to 3 characters. After that is put in and the return key has been hit, a series of other prompts will appear. Put in the correct information and when you're done, a logo with the shape, color and text you chose will appear.
